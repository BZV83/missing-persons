                            <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-0">The first step to combatting human trafficking is recognizing who is most susceptible, and when/where they are most at risk. Here are some common indicators of victims of human trafficking: <br>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Disconnection from loved ones
                                    <li> Lack of freedom, often caused by an over-imposing older figure
                                    <li> Restricted communication and fearful demeanor
                                    <li> Lack of personal possessions and documentation
                                    <li> Juvenile or commercial exchange of sexual favors
                                    <li> Minor injuries, including cuts and bruising
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                            <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-0">This is not an extensive list, and it often takes multiple indicators to be strong evidence of sex trafficking. However, recognizing these and other common signs of sex trafficking can help you know when you have the opportunity to act and help.</p>

Estimated at a $32 billion per year industry, millions of men, women, and children are trafficked in countries around, including the U.S. Although seemingly insurmountable, there are things anyone can do to assist in the worldwide effort to abolish this blatant breach of human dignity:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li> Volunteer and support anti-trafficking efforts in your community.
                                <li> Meet with or write to your local, state, and federal elected officials to let them know you care about combating human trafficking and ask what they are doing to address it.
                                <li> Be well-informed. Set up a web alert to receive current human trafficking news.
                                <li> Organize a fundraiser and donate the proceeds to an anti-trafficking organization.
                                <li> Use your social media platforms to raise awareness about human trafficking, using the following hashtags: #endtraffickingutah or #betheoneutah. Follow local, state, and national anti-trafficking social media accounts.
                                <li> Become a mentor to a young person or someone in need.
